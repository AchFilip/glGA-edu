
// Fake header file ! 

 
/* 
	Reason to exist :
	
	If the project has no header files (e.g Assignment1 has only Assignment1.cpp)
	CMake does not create a Header Files folder in Visual Studio solution! 
	Thus, when someone wants to create a header file for extending the specific project
	he will have no header files folder to put the .h file under!
	
	That's all.
